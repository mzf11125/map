## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-02

23 commits, 166 files changed since [v0.3.0](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/releases/tag/v0.3.0) (Apr 2026). Major additions: resilience use cases (civic participation, disbursement rails, identity continuity), I2U protection patterns, pattern/approach schema v2 (strict flip) with CROPS and post-quantum analysis, domain reframing beyond FIs, and a Q2 2026 content QA audit.

- chore: Q2 2026 content audit pass across all patterns, use cases, approaches, domains, jurisdictions, and vendors; corrections tracked in [QA-AUDIT.md](QA-AUDIT.md) ([#130](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/130))
- chore: remove the dormant `weekly-updates/` directory and `scripts/weekly-summary.sh` (single entry, unused since 2026-01) ([#130](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/130))
- docs(domains): reframe [Domains index](domains/README.md), [Payments](domains/payments.md), [Identity & Compliance](domains/identity-compliance.md), [Funds & Assets](domains/funds-assets.md), [Trading](domains/trading.md), and [Data & Oracles](domains/data-oracles.md) to cover public-sector, NGO, and resilience contexts alongside FIs; add [Civic Coordination & Governance](domains/governance.md) domain; add `governance` to the use-case schema enum ([#170](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/170), closes [#169](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/169))
- refactor(use-cases): rename `## 2) Additional Business Context` to `## 2) Additional Context` across [_template](use-cases/_template.md) and 23 use-case cards; strip reader-facing "Confidential context" placeholder line from 20 private-* cards ([#170](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/170), closes [#169](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/169))
- feat(use-case): [Resilient Civic Participation](use-cases/resilient-civic-participation.md) -- credentialed petition protocol with per-signer forward-secure ratcheting, blob-anchored signature batches, and a chain-state-only resolution SNARK (ECI, repository governance, workplace organising); adds [Approach: Civic Participation](approaches/approach-civic-participation.md) and generic patterns [Forward-Secure Pseudorandom Tree](patterns/pattern-forward-secure-pseudorandom-tree.md) and [Blob-Anchored State With KZG Dispute](patterns/pattern-blob-anchored-state-with-dispute.md) ([#165](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/165))
- chore(approach): I2U analysis pass across [Private Payments](approaches/approach-private-payments.md), [White-Label Deployment](approaches/approach-white-label-deployment.md), and [Private Broadcasting](approaches/approach-private-broadcasting.md). Adds [Self-Custodial Deployment](approaches/approach-white-label-deployment.md) (context: i2u) to White-Label. Relabels L1 Shielded Payments, Stateless Plasma, and Private Rollups from `i2i` to `both` where the underlying technology already serves end users. Closes [`#124`](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/124) ([`#167`](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/167))
- feat(pattern): [Private Information Retrieval](patterns/pattern-private-information-retrieval.md), plugs client-side query leakage in shielded-pool path retrieval and note discovery, and applies to any indexed lookup whose index is itself sensitive ([`#168`](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/168), companion to [ethsystems/pocs#68](https://github.com/ethsystems/pocs/issues/68))
- feat(pattern): [Immutable Guarantees](patterns/pattern-immutable-guarantees.md), separating mutable operational parameters from immutable safety invariants, with a published invariant set that survives hostile operators ([#166](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/166), closes [#127](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/127))
- fix(domains): refresh Adjacent vendors across [payments](domains/payments.md), [custody](domains/custody.md), [data-oracles](domains/data-oracles.md), [funds-assets](domains/funds-assets.md), [identity-compliance](domains/identity-compliance.md), and [trading](domains/trading.md). Remove Chainlink ACE (weak CROPS fit on openness and censorship resistance) and backfill with CROPS-aligned vendors already documented in [vendors/](vendors/) ([#164](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/164)).
- fix(ci): stabilize [full markdown link checks](.github/workflows/link-check-full.yml) by ignoring bot-blocked external references and repairing stale internal links ([#163](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/163))
- feat(schema): flip [pattern.json](scripts/schemas/pattern.json) and [validate-patterns.js](scripts/validate-patterns.js) to strict v2. All v1 aliases (`os`, `privacy`, `security` CROPS keys; `PoC`/`pilot`/`prod`/`experimental` maturity values; `privacy_goal`, `assumptions`, `dependencies`, `## Ingredients`, `## Guarantees` section names) now fail validation instead of warning. ([#156](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/156))
- feat(schema): approach template v2 -- replace [_template.md](approaches/_template.md) with the v2 skeleton from [#151](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/151) and update [validate-patterns.js](scripts/validate-patterns.js) to check v2 sections (`## Problem framing`, `## Approaches`, `## Comparison`, `## Persona perspectives`, `## Recommendation`, `## Open questions`), required frontmatter (`title`, `status`, `last_reviewed`, `use_case`, `primary_patterns`), and the `^Approach:\s` title prefix. Lenient mode (warnings only) until a future strict-flip ([#161](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/161))
- refactor(approach): port 9 approach cards in [approaches/](approaches/) to v2 schema (frontmatter, per-sub-approach YAML blocks, comparison table, persona perspectives, recommendation) ([#160](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/160), [#151](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/151))
- chore(approach): remove `approaches/approach-privacy-standards-survey.md` (does not fit v2 schema; relocation tracked in [#159](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/159)) ([#160](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/160))
- feat(use-case): [Resilient Disbursement Rails](use-cases/resilient-disbursement-rails.md) -- humanitarian disbursement to recipients in adversarial jurisdictions, with off-ramp unlinkability as the primary cryptographic requirement ([#157](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/157))
- feat(pattern): [Forward-Secure Signatures](patterns/pattern-forward-secure-signatures.md), [Mesh Store-and-Forward Submission](patterns/pattern-mesh-store-forward-submission.md), [Relay-Mediated Proving](patterns/pattern-relay-mediated-proving.md), and [Recipient-Derived Receive Addresses](patterns/pattern-recipient-derived-receive-addresses.md) -- generic patterns supporting constrained-signer participation in proof-gated systems ([#157](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/157))
- feat(approach): Resilient Disbursement Rails section in [Private Payments](approaches/approach-private-payments.md) for humanitarian disbursement under adversarial-jurisdiction threat models ([#157](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/157))
- feat(schema): pattern template v2 -- structured `crops_context`, `post_quantum`, `context_differentiation`, `related_patterns`, `open_source_implementations`, `sub_patterns`, and `type: meta` flag in [_template.md](patterns/_template.md), [pattern.json](scripts/schemas/pattern.json), and [validate-patterns.js](scripts/validate-patterns.js). Validator stays permissive during migration; existing v1 patterns continue to pass with deprecation warnings. ([#152](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/152), [#150](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/issues/150))
- feat(pattern): [ZK Wrappers](patterns/pattern-zk-wrappers.md) -- verify off-chain signatures (passport, DKIM, attestation) inside a ZK circuit for attribute proofs without credential disclosure ([#153](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/153))
- feat(pattern): [Social Recovery](patterns/pattern-social-recovery.md) -- guardian-quorum rotation of account keys or identity anchors without issuer or custodian involvement ([#153](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/153))
- feat(pattern): [Onion Routing](patterns/pattern-onion-routing.md) -- Tor-based multi-hop relay for sender IP anonymity (PSE tor-js, Flashbots .onion) ([#146](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/146))
- feat(pattern): [Mixnet Anonymity](patterns/pattern-mixnet-anonymity.md) -- batching, reordering, and cover traffic for strongest network anonymity (Nym, HOPR) ([#146](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/146))
- refactor(pattern): split [Network-Level Anonymity](patterns/pattern-network-anonymity.md) into umbrella pattern linking onion routing, mixnet, and TEE sub-patterns ([#146](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/146))
- feat(pattern): [User-Controlled Viewing Keys](patterns/pattern-user-controlled-viewing-keys.md) -- user-held viewing key custody for I2U privacy sovereignty ([#146](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/146))
- feat(pattern): enhance [Network-Level Anonymity](patterns/pattern-network-anonymity.md) with I2U analysis ([#146](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/146))
- feat(pattern): [zk-promises](patterns/pattern-zk-promises.md) -- stateful anonymous credentials with async callbacks for blind compliance enforcement ([#132](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/132))
- feat(pattern): [Proof of Innocence](patterns/pattern-proof-of-innocence.md) -- association set membership/exclusion proofs for compliance without surveillance ([#132](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/132))
- feat(approach|use-case): [Resilient Identity Continuity](use-cases/resilient-identity-continuity.md) and [added approach](approaches/approach-private-identity.md) ([#145](https://github.com/ethsystems/map/pull/145))

### Removed
